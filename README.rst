Nextpertise API Clients
=======================

These Nextpertise API client(s) in this repository are provided as samples
how the API can be accessed by client software.

This code is explicitly provided as an example.
You cannot expect to receive official support on these libraries.
However, any reported issues and comments will naturally be evaluated and (perhaps) acted upon.

Please note that this code is no replacement for the `official documentation`_.

The Python client
-----------------

Created by the Nextpertise developers.

You find the Python client in the python subdirectory.
You can install the Python client by copying the python/NextpertiseAPI directory into your project.

Note that it depends on the `Nextpertise/tinyrpc`_ library in our GitHub environment.

Included is sample.py showing you how the library is used and how the returned tree can be 
manipulated.

Contribute
----------

Contribution of client libraries in other languages are very welcome.
